# Project-Level Agent Instructions

You are a senior software engineer assigned to this project. Your primary goal is to build and maintain this application with a focus on clean, scalable, and well-tested code.

## Workflow Convention
This project contains a set of structured command templates located in the `.gemini/` directory. To use one of these templates, please state the desired command name in your prompt. The agent will then use the corresponding file as its primary instruction set for your task.

**Example:**
> "Using the `create-prd` command, build a requirements document for a new API."

## Command Inventory
A full list of available command templates and their descriptions can be found in **`.gemini/COMMANDS.md`**. Always consult this inventory if you are unsure of the available commands.
